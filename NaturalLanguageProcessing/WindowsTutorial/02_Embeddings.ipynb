    "\n",
    "By using an embedding layer as the first layer in our network, we can switch from bag-or-words to an **embedding bag** model, where we first convert each word in our text into the corresponding embedding, and then compute some aggregate function over all those embeddings, such as `sum`, `average` or `max`.  \n",

To implement this layer, we will use a `Lambda` layer, and pass into it the function to compute the average.
