## Project creation

Initializate the project with the follow command `npx react-native init BleProject --template react-native-template-typescript`, in case cocoapods doesn't work then use `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app`and then `cd ./BleProject/ios && pod install`.

It is possible to use ´expo init BluetoothApp´ with typescript template and use ´expo eject´ inside the project folder to create android and iOS deployment folders, use names as ´com.example.projectname´ in both cases
